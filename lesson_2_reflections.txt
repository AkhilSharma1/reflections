What happens when you initialize a repository? 
    A new git repository is created. A hidden folder named .git is added which contains the required files for version history.

Why do you need to do it?
    Without a repository, git cannot do anything. Git works only on git repositories.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
    The staging area is a monitored area by git. It is not required to contain all files from the working directory. 
    The files are not yet in the repository so you can still add/remove files from the staging area before making a commit.

What value do you think it offers?
    The option to create your set of files which you want to commit without having to add all new files. This way
    you have the option to make a split based on logical functionality


Commands:

git add  |    Add a file to the staging area
git commit  |    Commit the files from the staging area to the repository 
git status  |    Show which files are in the staging area, and which files are not part of the repository
